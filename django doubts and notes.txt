Does serializer only converts model to dictionary or vice versa too. Does it do anything else? - YES
How is dictionay converting to JSON in rest_framework api views - Django does under the hood itseems

Field should only be used for deseialization. During serialization dont get them. How to achieve this? - Maybe use write_only

If pipenv install is not actually installing package (pipenv graph shoes ?), then try this
pipenv update


â˜¤ An exception is raised during Locking dependencies...
Run pipenv lock --clear and try again. The lock sequence caches results to speed up subsequent runs. The cache may contain faulty results if a bug causes the format to corrupt, even after the bug is fixed. --clear flushes the cache, and therefore removes the bad results.
